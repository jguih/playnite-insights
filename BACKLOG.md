## üõ†Ô∏è In Progress

- Syncronization safety with Sync Id:
  - Client and server keeps the same sync id. Client send it on every sync request.
  - As long as client's sync id = server's sync id, the client is the source of truth and will overwrite server's data on every sync (last write wins).
  - On a server reset, either trigger manually through the UI or by completly wiping out all server data, where a new sync id will be generated, causing a mismatch, the server becomes the source of truth and all local data will be overwritten.
